# Generate a CSV list with geometries for ohsome-planet

To generate country id to parquet files generated by `ohsome-planet we would need to have a CSV like this for all countries in the world:
```csv
id;wkt
DEU;POLYGON ((7.954102 49.781264, 11.118164 49.781264, 11.118164 51.563412, 7.954102 51.563412, 7.954102 49.781264))
FRA;POLYGON ((1.186523 45.058001, 4.833984 45.058001, 4.833984 48.545705, 1.186523 48.545705, 1.186523 45.058001))
ITA;POLYGON ((10.766602 41.211722, 14.985352 41.211722, 14.985352 44.024422, 10.766602 44.024422, 10.766602 41.211722))
```

Your goal is to query the suitable geometries from overturemaps:

```bash
$Â duckdb -c "
    SELECT *
    
    FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-09-24.0/theme=divisions/type=division_boundary/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
    
    LIMIT 10
"
```

And when you have found how to query them you should output them into `countries.csv` using `duckdb` and document the commands you used in the end to `README.md`.
